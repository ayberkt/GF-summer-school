#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I seem to be missing a way in RGL to say "you eat and sleep". There doesn't seem to be any `Conj -> VP -> VP -> VP`, but I can say "you eat and you sleep" using a `Conj -> S -> S -> S`
#+END_QUOTE

* Difficulty

http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html describes `ListNP` but not `ListVP`

* Insight
however, http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/absfuns.html shows `ListVPS` and `ConjVPS` etc, which seem to trace in turn to Extra*

* Solution

see ~PandaEng.gf~
