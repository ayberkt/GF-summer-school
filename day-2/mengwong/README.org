If this problem stumped you, it might not be your fault: you might not have taken an introductory class in computer science.

If you had, you would have been exposed to the idea of recursion. The classic way of defining a recursive function is to begin with a *base case*.

Then you build upon it with an *inductive step.* In this example the inductive step would be "go up one floor". That's enough to construct an elevator that can go up any number of floors.

That's all we're doing in this assignment!

The second assignment just splits the inductive step in two directions.
